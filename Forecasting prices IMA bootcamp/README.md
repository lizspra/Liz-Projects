# Forecasting prices IMA bootcamp

This repository explores multiple forecasting methods to predict the cost of trucking for a logistics company for the next 3-12 months.

See White Paper.pdf for a deatiled descrpition of the project and the methods explored.

## Description

The main goal is to predict the cost of trucking for 3-12 months away based on historical data. For a specified trucking route, there is data given in the form of a time series, giving the weekly cost of trucking between 2017 and 2021. (The data presented here is a sanitized version of real data, as to protect the company.)
