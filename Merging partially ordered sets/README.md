# Merging Ordered Data

This project explores the problem of merging two different orderings on the same data set. 

## Description

Some data can come equipped with multiple different orderings or partial orderings. In general, two orderings do not have to be completely compatible. 

poset compatibility.py gives a measure for how compatible or not a collection of orderings are on the same underlying set. 

Order_poset_merging.pdf outlines of this question mathematically and gives some small examples, as well as some preliminary general results.
